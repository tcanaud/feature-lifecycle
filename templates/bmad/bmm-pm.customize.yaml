  The Feature Lifecycle Tracker provides unified feature visibility across the ecosystem:
  - BMAD artifacts (PRD, architecture, epics)
  - SpecKit artifacts (spec, plan, tasks, contracts)
  - Agreement status (exists, check PASS/FAIL)
  - ADR coverage (decisions referencing this feature)
  - Mermaid diagrams (L0/L1/L2 coverage)

  Lifecycle stages: ideation → spec → plan → tasks → implement → test → release
  Stages are automatically computed from artifact presence.
